Basic jquery animated header slide like on linkedin

when the scroll bar is less than 2 the header div is displayed and animates down

when the scroll bar is at 80 the div animates up and disapears.

very simple but quite nice - only a few lines of code

added a bit of css just to add some depth with box shadow and also google font cos Im 
bored using standard fonts all the time!!!!
